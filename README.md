# Miku UI Snowland Alpha release for Nintendo Switch(icosa)

Sorry, no source code here, I just make it for release.

## NOTICE (IMPORTANT!)

THIS IS **NOT** AN OFFICIAL RELEASE AND STILL ALPHA.

YOU WILL FACE MILLIONS OF GLITCHES BY INSTALLING IT TO YOUR NINTENDO SWITCH AND EVEN BREAK YOUR DEVICE.

I RELEASE IT JUST FOR SOMEONE WHO REALLY WANNA HAVE A TASTE! 

IF YOU REALLY WANNA HAVE A TRY, TAKE YOUR OWN RISK!

## Install guide

1. Format your SDcrad as FAT32
2. Extract the zip to the root of you SDcard
3. Boot your Switch into hekate (already included in the zip)
4. Select Tools -> Partition SD Card
5. Use sliders to select appropriate space for Android, then press Next Step
6. Follow instructions and backup Nintendo folder or any CFW files if necessary via hekate's SD UMS tool over USB-C or by removing the SD card and reading directly on a PC (hekate/Nyx can pause and reload when SD is removed)
7. Plug the Switch into your PC and select "SD UMS"
8. Extract the zip to the root of the SD card again
9. Safely remove/eject the SD UMS device
10. Back on the Switch, select "Flash Android" and accpt the prompt to reboot to recovery (TWRP)
11. Press Install, then "Select Storage" in TWRP and select "Micro SD Card"
12. Flash Miku UI
13. Enjoy. (●ˇ∀ˇ●)

## Known issues
- RsMouse not work
- Audio not work
- Sensors are down
- Miku Home(Launcher) keeps crashing, so you better install another custom launcher like Nova Launcher
- The whole system is glithy, but it boots

Again, it just for someone who wanna try Android 12L on Switch.
